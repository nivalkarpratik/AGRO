            <ol>
                <li>Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil for planting sunflowers.</li>
                <li>Plant sunflower seeds directly in the soil or start them indoors and transplant seedlings after the last frost.</li>

                <li>Provide support for tall varieties by staking or using other support structures.</li>
                <li>Fertilize the soil with a balanced fertilizer to promote healthy growth and vibrant blooms.</li>
                <li>Deadhead spent flowers to encourage continuous blooming and prevent seed formation, if desired.</li>
                <li>Harvest sunflower seeds when the flower head has matured, and the back of the head turns brown.</li>
