            <h2>Extra Information</h2>
            <p>Avocados are not only delicious but also offer numerous health benefits. They contain monounsaturated fats, which are heart-healthy, and are a good source of vitamins C, E, K, and B-6. Avocado trees are sensitive to frost, so it's essential to protect them in colder climates. Consider adding avocados to your home garden for a sustainable and rewarding source of this nutritious fruit.</p>
