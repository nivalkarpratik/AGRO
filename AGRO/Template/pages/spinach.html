            <h2>Steps to Grow Spinach</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Choose a location with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight for spinach cultivation.</li>
                <li>Sow spinach seeds directly in the garden or in containers, ensuring proper spacing.</li>
                <li>Water the spinach regularly, keeping the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.</li>
                <li>Provide shade during hot weather to prevent spinach from bolting (going to seed prematurely).</li>
                <li>Fertilize the soil with a balanced fertilizer to promote healthy leafy growth.</li>
                <li>Harvest spinach by cutting the outer leaves when they reach a suitable size, leaving the inner leaves to continue growing.</li>
